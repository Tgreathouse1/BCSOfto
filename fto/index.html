      <!-- Cadet Handover Procedure -->
      <div class="section" id="handover">
        <h2>Cadet Handover Procedure</h2>
                <p>The following will be the first steps you take when you are paired with  a Cadet.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Confirm Callsign</b><br>
            "Do you have an assigned callsign? If not. open your MDT by thinking /MDT. click MDT, Dashboard and select your name in the bottom left cornor. from there select change callsign and do the same on your handheld radio by opening it, pressing the gear icon and editing your name and callsign/"
          </li>
          <li><b>Set Unavailable</b><br>
            FTO sets MDT status to 10-7 (unavailable).<br>
            This is to ensure you have full focus on providing all info to the cadet and no steps are missing for onboarding. the guide will inform when you may go back 10-8 and proceed to patrol'"
             <li><b>Follow Training Guide</b><br>
           Please ensure to use this training guide as accurate as possible to ensure no missed steps. we should not move a cadet onto the next phase unless you as an FTO feel 100% positive that they understand everything in that phase 
          </li>
          <li><b>Open FTO Report</b><br>
            At the end of the shift "or" completed phase you MUST open your MDT open a FTO report with the required information and grade the phase appropriatly "Open a new FTO report in the MDT. Log: 'Training Start — Cadet [Name], FTO [Name], Date/Time.' This report will track all training progress and feedback."
              <div style="background:#ffe066;border-left:6px solid #1a3a5b;padding:12px 18px;margin:12px 0;">
                <b>FTO Report Grading Policy:</b><br>
                You must input and grade 100% honest, unbiased opinions of the cadet's scores. For phases 1-4, you will grade cadets on the following topics:
                <ul style="margin-top:8px;">
                  <li>Professionalism</li>
                  <li>SOP Knowledge</li>
                  <li>Communication</li>
                  <li>Driving</li>
                  <li>Level of Force</li>
                  <li>Decision Making</li>
                  <li>Report Writing</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Phase 1 Grading Instruction:</b> All grades in phase one should be marked as 3 out of 5. In the notes, clearly state the cadet has not done or not gone over this section yet.
                Leave very detailed notes in each section about what has or has not been covered, and where the next FTO should pick up. After phase 4 is completed, you are required to read off and question the cadet by following the grading manual.<br>
                Failure to maintain and meet these requirements will result in corrective action, such as repeating the FTO course and report writing training, and may be elevated to high command's attention.

        <h3>Radio Procedure: Going On/Off Duty</h3>
        <ol style="margin-top:0;">
      <li style="margin-bottom:18px;"><strong>Going On Duty:</strong> Instruct the cadet to ensure they are properly clocked in before starting patrol. They must radio: <strong>'Bravo [callsign] 10-8, 10-41'</strong> to indicate they are available and starting their shift. Emphasize that this must be done correctly the first time to maintain accurate duty records.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:18px;"><strong>Radio Setup – Going Off Duty:</strong> Inform the cadet that at the end of their shift, they must radio: <strong>'Bravo [callsign] 10-7, 10-42'</strong>, indicating they are going off duty and ending their shift.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:18px;"><strong>Radio Etiquette:</strong> Inform the cadet that they do not need to memorize every radio code perfectly. If they are unsure of a code or what to say, take a moment to think, and ensure they can get their point across clearly in 2–3 seconds. Always include their <strong>location</strong> and relevant <strong>details</strong>. For example, if the cadet does not remember that a 10-70 is a foot pursuit, they can simply say: <strong>'Foot pursuit in progress, Inbound on Innocence Blvd, white male, red shorts, white tank top'</strong>.</li>

    <h2>Phase 2: 5 Levels of Force, MDT & Booking</h2>
        <li><b>Cadet Observation & Callouts</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">During Phase 2, cadets should begin doing callouts and participate in their second shift. Cadets should not drive until Phase 3. Phase 2 is focused on learning procedures, callouts, and basic field operations under close FTO supervision.</span></li>

    <li><b>Probable Cause vs. Reasonable Suspicion</b><br>
      <span style="color:#4da3ff;"><b>Reasonable Suspicion:</b> Specific, articulable facts that suggest a person may be involved in criminal activity. This allows officers to briefly stop, question, or frisk someone for weapons.<br>
      <i>Example:</i> An officer sees someone pacing nervously outside a closed store late at night, looking into windows. The officer may stop and question the person based on reasonable suspicion.<br><br>
      <b>Probable Cause:</b> A reasonable basis, supported by facts and evidence, for believing a crime has been, is being, or will be committed. Probable cause is required for arrests, search warrants, and full searches.<br>
      <i>Example:</i> An officer smells marijuana, sees drug paraphernalia in plain view, and finds a large amount of cash during a traffic stop. These facts together provide probable cause to search the vehicle and arrest the suspect.<br><br>
      <b>Key Difference:</b> Reasonable suspicion allows for temporary detention and investigation; probable cause is needed for arrests and full searches. Always document your facts and reasoning in the MDT.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li><b>Maximum Jail Time</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">The maximum jail sentence is 3 hours (180 months). Never exceed this limit for any suspect.</span></li>
  <li><b>Miranda Rights Script</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Officers must read the full Miranda warning any time a suspect is detained or arrested—not just before interrogation. In general, we will double-check at the station that the suspect is aware of their rights and understands them.<br><br><span style="font-weight:700; color:#111; background:#f6f6f6; padding:8px 12px; border-radius:6px; display:inline-block;">“You have the right to remain silent”<br>“Anything you say can, and will be used against you in a court of law”<br>“You have the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you by the State of San Andreas, if available”<br>“Do you understand these rights as I have just read them?”</span><br><br>If the suspect does not understand, repeat or clarify. Document in your report that rights were read and acknowledged at the scene and again at the station.</span></li>
    <li><b>Hostage Handling After Release</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Immediately separate hostages from suspects. Get each hostage’s name for the report. Search hostages for weapons, drugs, or stolen items that may have been planted. Ask hostages what happened and document their statements. Provide medical attention if needed. Record all findings and actions in MDT.</span></li>
    <li><b>Booking and Report Writing</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Follow BCSO SOP: Process the suspect, enter charges, collect evidence, and write a detailed report including all facts, evidence, and witness statements. Reports must be complete, detailed, and accurate. Always link evidence and witness statements to the MDT report.</span></li>        <ul>
          <li><b>5 Levels of Force</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">All officers must follow the 5 levels of force:</span>
            <ol>
              <li>Officer Presence — Uniformed officer or marked vehicle presence</li>
              <li>Verbal Commands — Clear, understandable directions</li>
              <li>Empty Hand Techniques — Soft/hard physical control (e.g., restraining, tackling)</li>
              <li>Less Lethal Force — Taser, baton, bean bag rounds (warn 3 times before deploying)</li>
              <li>Lethal Force — Firearms or any weapon likely to cause serious injury or death</li>
            </ol>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">Always escalate or de-escalate based on threat level and document all use of force.</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Scene Staffing Limit</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">All scenes are maxed to 6 BCSO officers unless an officer is downed. Additional units may only join if an officer is injured or downed and requires assistance.</span>

          <div style="color:#4da3ff; margin-bottom:1em;">Follow these detailed steps to properly book a suspect after arrest:</div>
          <h4>Search Procedures for Suspects</h4>
          <div style="background:#eaf6ff;border-left:6px solid #4da3ff;padding:12px 18px;margin-bottom:18px;max-width:700px;">
            Any and all personnel brought into the PD garage or secured areas must be searched twice: once while on scene and once in the garage before entering the building. Use third eye (Left Alt + Right Click) to search, or use your F6/F9 muscle for the police menu to search. This is mandatory for officer safety and evidence integrity.
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">Remove the suspect from the vehicle and pat their pockets down one last time for assurance.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">Ask and confirm the suspect was Mirandized; if unsure, Mirandize them again.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">Walk with or escort the suspect into the processing room and have them line up in front of the height board.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">Remove any masks, hats, glasses, and objects blocking the suspect’s face. Pull out your PD-issued camera and take a booking photo.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">Remove any gloves or objects blocking the suspect’s fingers. Search for identification, ID, or driver’s license and check their MDT profile to see if the image matches. If not, or if they have no ID, proceed to fingerprint.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">Walk the suspect to the fingerprint scanner and scan their fingerprints. If no matches come back, input their first and last name into the system and ensure it is up to date. If not in the system, hold the suspect until you can identify them and contact a supervisor.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">If the suspect is identified and cooperates, move them to a cell, placing them alone (never with another individual). Use /me to remove radio, phone, etc.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">Start a report, add charges, and once charges are read off to the suspect, ask if they plead guilty or not guilty.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">If guilty, charge them through the tablet (not MDT) via billing. Once fines are auto-removed, use /jail id time, then write your report in detail only after sending off the suspect.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">If not guilty, the charge is x3 for the fine and they are released after placing an ankle monitor and informing them they have 24 hours to contact a judge.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:18px;">All evidence should be properly stored in the evidence locker, using a prefix of 100 (e.g., MDT report #114, evidence goes in locker 100114). Link the MDT report to the evidence number; all evidence should auto-populate in the report.</li>

      <!-- Phase 3: Patrol Operations & Booking Procedures -->
      <div class="section" id="phase-3">
  <li><b>Driving Begins</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Cadets may begin driving patrol vehicles in Phase 3. FTOs should actively help and coach cadets as they drive and perform patrol duties.</span></li>
  <li><b>Speed Limits</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">City: 60 MPH, Freeway: 100 MPH. Only exceed these limits for Code 2 or Code 3 calls, and always prioritize safety.</span></li>
  <li><b>Code 5 Rules & Instructions</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Code 5 is a coordinated felony stop. Announce “Code 5” on radio and wait for backup. Position vehicles for maximum cover and safety. Use PA or radio to order all occupants out, one at a time, hands visible. Do not approach until all suspects are secured and cleared. Only supervisors may override or change Code 5 procedures.</span></li>
  <li><b>Pursuit Policy & Orders</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Pursuits are only allowed for felonies or serious crimes. Announce pursuit on radio, update location and direction. Terminate if unsafe (high risk to public/officers). Use spike strips only with supervisor approval. After pursuit, complete a detailed MDT report including reason, actions, and outcome.</span></li>
  <li><b>MDT Usage for Specific Tasks</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Use MDT to issue/remove licenses, manage BOLOs, link evidence, and write reports. Always double-check spelling, dates, and details. Attach all relevant evidence and witness statements.</span></li>
  <li><b>Report Format</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Reports must include: Title (Date — Incident Type — Suspect Name), Date/Time of incident, Involved parties (suspects, victims, witnesses), Charges filed, Evidence attached (photos, items, statements), Summary of actions taken and outcome.</span></li>
  <li><b>Fines and Billing</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Fines are processed through the tablet, not MDT. If suspect pleads not guilty, fine is tripled (x3) and they are released with an ankle monitor. Suspect has 24 hours to contact a judge for appeal. Document plea and billing in the report.</span></li>
        <h2>Phase 3: Driving, Patrol Operations and Vehicles</h2>
        <div style="color:#4da3ff;margin:10px 0 8px 0;">This phase covers all driving, patrol, and vehicle operations. <b>Note:</b> Cadets do not receive their own patrol vehicle until the end of Phase 4. In Phase 3, the FTO will show the cadet how to use PD vehicles, which vehicles are allowed, and how to fit vehicles at La Mesa. Cadets may drive only approved vehicles under FTO supervision.</div>
        <ul style="background:#fffbe6;border-left:6px solid #ffe066;padding:12px 18px;margin-bottom:18px;">
          <li><b>Vehicle Eligibility & Setup</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">FTO: "Cadets must drive the Crown Vic or Taurus patrol units until they are promoted to Deputy. Other vehicles in the PD garage (Tahoe, Raptor, Tacmed, Toyota Camry) are reserved for command. All vehicles must have light bars present except for command vehicles and above. Vehicles must be taken to the shop at La Mesa for proper livery and light bar installation; other shops will not be refunded. Cadets may only drive under FTO supervision and do not receive their own car until the end of Phase 4."</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Prowler Radar Setup & Use</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">FTO: "Before you drive, let's set up your Prowler radar. Press the assigned key (usually F5 or a custom bind) to open the radar interface. You can set your speed threshold by adjusting the speed dial—this will alert you when vehicles exceed the set speed. To activate the radar, press the 'Activate' button. You can toggle between front/rear radar and set the detection range. Practice changing the speed threshold and activating/deactivating the radar until comfortable."</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Plate Scanner & BOLO Management</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">FTO: "Open the plate scanner from the radar interface. To scan a plate, drive behind a vehicle and press the 'Scan' button. The system will display the plate number, owner, and any flags. To set a BOLO (Be On the Lookout), enter the plate number and details in the BOLO tab, then press 'Add BOLO.' To remove a BOLO, select it from the list and press 'Remove.' Practice scanning plates and managing BOLOs before going on patrol."</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Driving Rules & Speed Limits</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">All officers must follow department speed limits unless responding to emergencies. Speeding and running lights are only permitted on Code 2 and Code 3 calls:</span>
            <ul>
              <li><b>City Speed Limit:</b> 60 MPH (patrol and civilian)</li>
              <li><b>Freeway Speed Limit:</b> 100 MPH (patrol and civilian)</li>
              <li><b>Code 1:</b> No lights/sirens, follow all traffic laws and speed limits.</li>
              <li><b>Code 2:</b> Lights only, may exceed speed limit only to clear intersections or respond to priority calls, but must use caution and not exceed safe speeds.</li>
              <li><b>Code 3:</b> Lights and sirens, may exceed speed limit only for life-threatening emergencies, but must always prioritize safety and risk management.</li>
            </ul>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">Always slow down at intersections and use sirens/lights appropriately. Reckless driving or excessive speeding will result in discipline.</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Search Procedures for Suspects</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">Any and all personnel brought into the PD garage or secured areas must be searched twice: once while on scene and once in the garage before entering the building. Use third eye (Left Alt + Right Click) to search, or use your F6/F9 muscle for the police menu to search. This is mandatory for officer safety and evidence integrity.</span>
          <li><b>SWAT Scene Control</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">If SWAT is deployed, it becomes their scene. All other units must follow SWAT command and instructions.</span></li>
          <li><b>Scene Priority & Union Callout</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Anytime an FTO is with a cadet, they must call out their callsign and the cadet’s callsign to form a "union" (e.g., "Union One"). If there may be other unions, call and ask how many are currently activated. Scene priority must be established at the start of any major incident.</span></li>
          <li><b>Vehicle Evidence Rule</b><br><span style="color:#4da3ff;">Anytime a deputy is on scene and there is a vehicle present, the plate and vehicle must be photographed and placed into evidence.</span></li>
        </ul>

            <b>Evidence Collection & Processing:</b><br>
            Anytime you use a flashlight to collect blood, casings, or any form of evidence, you must take these to the lab at PD. Walk up to the processing machine, process the sample, and it will be retrievable at the cooler in storage. Here, it will provide info such as who the blood belongs to, the type of firearm, and any linking details the casing has. Always process and document evidence for every case.

          <li><b>House Robberies & Negotiations</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">For house robberies, follow these protocols:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>If there is 1 hostage, suspects may make up to 2 demands. Free passage counts as 1 demand.</li>
              <li>If there is more than 1 hostage, refer to SOP for additional allowed demands.</li>
              <li>If there are no hostages, confirm with all officers. If suspects have big guns, you may ask a supervisor to activate SWAT. If no supervisor is present, the team lead or you may need to take lead, stack up, and breach the building.</li>
              <li>Without a hostage, suspects are not allowed demands. Attempt negotiations, but demands are not required.</li>
              <li>Suspects may request anything except PD equipment, gear, or vehicles unless authorized by high command.</li>
              <li>Always use case law and department SOPs for guidance during negotiations and patrol.</li>
            </ul>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">Reference: See SOP for full house robbery and negotiation instructions.</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Case Law & Evidence Requirements</b><br>
            <span style="color:#4da3ff;">When searching people or vehicles for weapons, ensure you have probable cause or request K9 if needed. For traffic stops (e.g., speeding), you must have photo evidence of the radar displaying their speed and complete a full report if issuing a fine.</span>
            <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
              <li><b>Terry v. Ohio (1968):</b> Officers may conduct a brief stop and frisk (Terry Frisk) if they have reasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous.</li>
              <li><b>Arizona v. Gant (2009):</b> Officers may search a vehicle incident to arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or if it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense.</li>
              <li><b>Miranda v. Arizona (1966):</b> Suspects must be informed of their rights before custodial interrogation; statements made without Miranda warning may be inadmissible.</li>

              <li>Always prioritize the safety of hostages and civilians above all else.</li>
              <li>Establish communication with the suspect and remain calm, professional, and patient.</li>
              <li>Gather information: number of hostages, suspect demands, weapons, and location.</li>
              <li>Do not make promises you cannot keep. Use time to your advantage and keep the suspect talking.</li>
              <li>Maintain a safe perimeter and keep all officers updated on the situation.</li>
              <li>Only a supervisor (Sergeant or above) may authorize activation of SWAT or ECU. Request a supervisor if escalation is needed.</li>
              <li>Follow department SOPs for negotiations, SWAT/ECU activation, and incident documentation.</li>
              <li>After resolution, debrief all involved parties and complete a detailed MDT report.</li>
